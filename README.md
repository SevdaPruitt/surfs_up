#SURFS UP CHALLENGE

Overview of the analysis: 
I have been working with W.Avy and he asked more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Data on the months of June and December in Oahu are important, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. The information I have been pulling is very important in terms of long term sustainabilty goals for the business.


Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

Summary: 
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
